# Project Proposal: Predicting a Country's Happiness Index

## Description of the Project
The goal of this project is to predict a country's happiness index based on socio-economic and demographic factors derived from the **World Happiness Report** dataset available on **Kaggle**. The happiness index reflects the subjective well-being of individuals in various countries, influenced by factors such as:

- GDP per capita
- Social support
- Life expectancy
- Freedom to make life choices
- Perceptions of corruption

This analysis will provide insights into what drives happiness across different nations and help inform policy decisions aimed at improving the quality of life.

## Goals
1. **Develop a Predictive Model**: Create a model that can accurately predict a countryâ€™s happiness index using key socio-economic indicators. This will help identify which factors are the strongest predictors of happiness. We will try to predict the happiness index for the year of 2023 using a model trained on previous years.
  
2. **Identify Key Factors Influencing Happiness**: Analyze the dataset to determine the significant variables that impact happiness levels. This could involve exploring correlations and conducting feature importance analysis.

## Data Collection

### Primary Data Source
The main dataset will be sourced from **Kaggle's "World Happiness Report,"** which includes annual happiness scores for various countries along with associated factors like:

- Happiness index (dependent variable)
- Economic indicators (e.g., GDP per capita)
- Social factors (e.g., social support, life expectancy)
- Freedom to make life choices
- Perceptions of corruption
- Etc.

### Data Collection Method
- **Kaggle Dataset**: The dataset will be downloaded directly from Kaggle.
  
- **Web Scraping**: If needed, we will scrape data from reliable sources such as the **World Bank** and the **United Nations**. For instance, we can collect recent economic indicators or demographic statistics that complement the happiness data.

- **APIs**: Explore APIs from organizations like the **World Bank** to gather updated information about various socio-economic indicators.

### Data Cleaning
The collected data will be preprocessed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize data formats. This step is crucial to ensure the reliability of the predictive model.

## Modeling Approach

### Data Preparation
- Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables.

### Modeling Techniques
- We will begin with **linear regression** for baseline predictions.
- Explore advanced models such as **decision trees** or **k-means** to capture more complex relationships, as well as other methods of modeling learned in class.
- Consider using **neural networks** if data complexity warrants such an approach.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R-squared**

## Data Visualization

### Visualization Techniques
- Scatter plots to illustrate relationships between individual factors and the happiness index.
- Correlation heatmaps to identify strong relationships among variables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct EDA to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset through various visualizations.

## Test Plan
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset will be split into training and testing sets to evaluate model predictive capabilities.

## Conclusion
This project aims to leverage the insights from the **World Happiness Report** dataset to create a predictive model of a country's happiness index. By identifying key factors that influence happiness and generating actionable recommendations for policymakers, we hope to contribute to the ongoing discourse around improving well-being. The project will combine data analysis, modeling techniques, and effective visualization to provide an understanding of what drives happiness across different nations.
